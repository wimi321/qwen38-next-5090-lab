"""`--tool-call-parser auto` / `--reasoning-parser auto`: architecture -> parser name.

Three tables are maintained independently -- the model registry, the substring cascade in
``server/args.py``, and the two parser factories -- and nothing links them. Add a model family and
forget the cascade, and the model serves perfectly: it just stops emitting tool calls and stops
separating out its thinking, because it silently fell through to the generic default. Every other
parser test still passes, since they all start from a parser name that is already correct.

So this drives the *live* registry rather than a list: a newly registered architecture is covered
the moment it is added, and has to be dispositioned here to stay green.
