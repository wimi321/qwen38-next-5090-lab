"""Hide high-frequency status polling traffic from uvicorn's access log.

Compatible status clients poll a handful of read-only endpoints every 1-2s to keep their UI
current: ``GET /health`` (lifecycle), ``GET /v1/stats`` (runtime metrics), ``GET /v1/requests``
(request-log ring, carries a ``?since=&limit=`` query string), ``GET /v1/cache/status``, and a
bare ``GET /v1`` liveness probe. Uvicorn's ``uvicorn.access`` logger logs every one of these at
INFO, which floods both the engine's stdout and client log views with repetitive lines.

These lines are registered as debug-level noise (per spec): suppressed by default, and only
shown once the engine's existing verbosity knob -- the ``LOG_LEVEL`` env var consumed by
:func:`freetoken.utils.init_logger` -- is raised to ``DEBUG`` (e.g. ``LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG``).
Everything else -- non-GET requests, and any other endpoint such as
``POST /v1/chat/completions`` -- is always logged, unaffected by this filter.
